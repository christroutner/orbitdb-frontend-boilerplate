# orbitdb-frontend-boilerplate

This is a Gatsby front end boilerplate. It's intended to be paired with the [orbit-api-boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/orbitdb-api-boilerplate). This boilerplate was forked from an early version of [tor-list-frontend](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/tor-list-frontend).

The front end boilerplate will read and write from an OrbitDB using the REST API served by orbit-api-boilerplate.
